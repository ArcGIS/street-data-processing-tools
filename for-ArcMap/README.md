# Street Data Processing Tools (ArcMap version)

The tools process shapefile data from TomTom® MultiNet® or HERE™ NAVSTREETS™ into a file geodatabase network dataset. This version of the toolbox must be run in ArcMap.

## Software Requirements

DEPRECATION NOTICE: This version of the tool is deprecated because a version of this tool for ArcGIS Pro is now available and ArcMap is in the mature support phase and will be retired in 2026.  No further updates will be made to this tool, and only minimal support will be provided.  Please migrate your workflows to ArcGIS Pro.

* ArcGIS 10.8 or later
* ArcView (Basic) license or higher
* ArcGIS Network Analyst Extension
* If you have installed ArcGIS for Desktop Background Geoprocessing (64 Bit) update, the tools will run only if background geoprocessing is disabled.

## Installation
To install the tools

1. Download the latest version of [StreetDataProcessingTools_v*.zip](https://github.com/ArcGIS/street-data-processing-tools/releases/latest) file.
2. Extract the contents of the archive to a folder, and open the `for-ArcMap` subfolder.
3. Right-click `GPProcessVendorDataFunctions.dll` and select Properties.
4. In the Properties dialog, click the General tab and then click Unblock button in the Security section. Click Ok to save the changes and close the properties dialog.
5. Right-click the `InstallTools.bat` file and select Run as administrator.

To use the tools, from the Catalog Window in ArcMap or the Catalog Tree in ArcCatalog, browse to the folder where you extracted the archive and run the tools within the Street Data Processing Tools toolbox. The tools require ArcGIS 10.8 or later, however the tools can be used to create network datasets that can be used with ArcGIS 10.1 or later or ArcGIS Pro.
